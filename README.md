## vscode-wow-api (WIP)
Shows [API Documentation](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/tree/live/AddOns/Blizzard_APIDocumentation) in VSCode  
This should be compatible with Sumneko's [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server) since it only provides API completion for now.

### Features
* Currently it only supports code completion for Blizzard documented API functions
